The base template is Zen Cart is called [template_default](/user/template/template_default/). 

`classic` is a sample custom template. You can create your own custom templates;  `classic` is just an example. Anything that's not in your custom template but exists in template_default will be automatically loaded from template_default for you. Thus, when you're building a custom template, all you need in your custom template folder are the files/folders that you've customized/changed/added. Everything else is taken from the [default files](/user/first_steps/overrides/#default-files). 

`responsive_classic` is another sample custom template which works on mobile devices.
