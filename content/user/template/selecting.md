Zen Cart comes with two built-in templates: the classic template and the responsive_classic template.   

The classic template is no longer appropriate for use as a primary template, since it is not [responsive](/user/template/responsive/).  Which leaves us with just the responsive_classic template. 

Is responsive_classic good enough for your store? That's a decision only you can make - but you should exercise caution when evaluating templates from vendors like Themeforest and Template Monster.  Although they are visually appealing, many of their products were built **years** ago and have not been updated.  This means: 

- They still have bugs that have long since been fixed in responsive_classic. 
- They will not work under the latest version of PHP without creating [debug logs](/user/troubleshooting/debug_logs/) - often several per page load.  This not only slows down your store, it means that it will be quite difficult to resolve problems.
- They do not contain the [latest javascript libraries](/user/upgrading/javascript_updates/). 

The same issue can of course occur when you use a template from the [Plugins Library](/user/plugins/plugin_library/), although these come with community support on the [Zen Cart forum](/user/zen_cart_forum/).
