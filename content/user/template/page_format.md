Because of the reduced screensize on a mobile device, pages look different. 

Here's the same page on a mobile phone: 

<img alt="Page on a phone" src="/images/page_phone.png" width="40%" />

And here's the same page on a tablet: 

<img alt="Page on a tablet" src="/images/page_tablet.png" width="80%" />

On those devices, the hamburger menu on the top left allows you to view additional page content.
