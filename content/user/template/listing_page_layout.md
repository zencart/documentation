Listing Pages are used to show groups of results.  Examples of listing pages are: 

- Specials 
- Featured Products
- Categories 
- Search Results 

The relevant settings for all listing pages are in [Admin > Configuration > Product Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productlisting/).  There are also specific configurations for these pages: 

- Product Category listing pages are configured by [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/).
- The New Products page is configured by [Admin > Configuration > New Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_newlisting/).
- The Featured Products page is configured by [Admin > Configuration > Featured Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_featuredlisting/).
- The All Products page is configured by [Admin > Configuration > All Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_alllisting/).

[Listing pages are paginated](/user/template/pagination/) so that only a subset of the total number of results are shown.  Navigation is provided between blocks of results.
