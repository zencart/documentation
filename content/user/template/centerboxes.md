Centerboxes are pieces of content that are displayed in the middle of the screen in the Zen Cart storefront. 

You can learn about [controlling centerboxes in the admin](/user/admin/centerboxes/) so that you only display the centerboxes that are most important to your store. 

This is the Featured Products centerbox.

There are four centerboxes that are built in to Zen Cart: 

- New Products
- Featured Products
- Special Products
- Upcoming Products

### Centerboxes and Mobile

Centerboxes will appear on a mobile device in the expected place.  

<img alt="Centerbox on tablet" src="/images/centerboxes_mobile.png" />

This behavior is different from that of [sideboxes](/user/template/sideboxes/), which are commonly hidden on mobile. 

### Centerbox Controls

The number of products shown in a centerbox is controlled using an Admin setting on the page [Admin > Configuration > Maximum Values](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_maximumvalues/).  Note that names of these settings changed in Zen Cart 1.5.8.

Centerbox Name | Pre-1.5.8 | 1.5.8 and above | 
---------------|-----------|-----------------|
Specials  | Maximum Display of Specials Products - Main Page | Products on Special Centerbox 
New Products | New Products Module | New Products Centerbox
Featured Products | Maximum Display of Featured Products - Main Page | Featured Products Centerbox 
Upcoming Products | Upcoming Products | Upcoming Products Centerbox

###  Creating your own centerbox 

In addition to the four built-in centerboxes described above, other centerboxes are available in the [Zen Cart plugins library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php).  Try searching for both "centerbox" and "centerboxes" in the Advanced Search with "Search Titles Only" set.
