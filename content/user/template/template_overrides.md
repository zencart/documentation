Before you read this, please review 
[basic terms](/user/first_steps/basic_terms/),
[template default and default files](/user/first_steps/overrides/) and 
[overrides for new users](/user/new_user_topics/overrides/). 

## Introduction 

Overrides were created to simplify upgrading and templating. 

## What Can I Override? 
Any file which exists in a folder which has a `classic` subfolder 
can be overridden. 

As of Zen Cart 1.5.6, this list is: 

```
includes/languages/
includes/languages/english/extra_definitions/
includes/languages/english/
includes/languages/english/html_includes/
includes/languages/english/modules/payment/
includes/languages/english/modules/shipping/
includes/languages/english/modules/order_total/
includes/modules/
includes/modules/sideboxes/
```

In addition, you can override: 

```
includes/index_filters/ 
```


You can also override any folder in your template folder.
Again as of 1.5.6, this list is: 

```
YOUR_TEMPLATE/buttons/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/common/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/css/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/images/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/info_shopping_cart/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/jscript/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/popup_attributes_qty_prices/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/popup_coupon_help/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/popup_cvv_help/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/popup_image/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/popup_image_additional/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/popup_search_help/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/popup_shipping_estimator/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/sideboxes/
YOUR_TEMPLATE/templates/
```

You can also place overrides in these folders: 
```
./includes/auto_loaders/overrides/
./includes/init_includes/overrides/
./admin/includes/auto_loaders/overrides/
./admin/includes/init_includes/overrides/
```

## What Can I NOT Override? 

At the moment, these elements of your cart do not support overrides:

- Admin
- `includes/modules/pages`
- The `shipping`, `payment` and `order total` folders under `includes/modules`


## Other Mechanisms 
There are also other mechanisms to allow you modify the 
behavior of the system without touching core files.
These are more advanced topics, intended for developers. 

- [Notifiers/Observers](/dev/code/notifiers/)
- [Init System](/dev/code/init_system/)
- [Extra folders](/dev/code/extra_folders/) 

See also [plugin tips](/dev/plugins/tips/) for more suggestions. 

## Using your Overrides 

You've created some overrides and now you want to use your new template!

Just create the `template_info.php` file and activate your template. 
See [the template_info FAQ](/user/template/template_info/). 


## Next Steps 

- See [how to create a new template](/user/template/creating_template/).

- See [how to customize your new template](/user/template/customizing_template/).

- Learn to use the [Developers Tool Kit](/user/admin/developers_toolkit/).
It will help you track down the files that you need to change to get the results you want.
