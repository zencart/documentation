When a [listing page](/user/templates/listing_page_layout/) is created, the results are shown in blocks, with naviation between blocks of results. For example, here's the Specials page on a mobile device.

<br><br>

There are 27 specials, which are displayed in groups of 9.  The pagination controls are shown at the top of the page in mobile in this template.  (It is also present at the bottom.)

The desktop display is similar, but because a desktop screen is wider, more products per row can be shown.

<br><br>

Pagination controls are provided in the Zen Cart admin on the page [Admin > Configuration > Maximum Values](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_maximumvalues/): 

Page Name | Control 
----------|------- 
Specials  | Products on Special
New Products | New Products Listing- Number Per Page 
Featured Products | Maximum Display of Featured Products Page
Advanced Search Results | Products Listing- Number Per Page 
Index Listing | Products Listing- Number Per Page 
All Products | Maximum Display of Products All Page 

<br><br>

The behavior and appearance of the **Next** and **Previous** links is controlled using settings on the [Admin > Configuration > Product Info](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productinfo/) page.
