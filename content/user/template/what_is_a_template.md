A template (sometimes called a "theme") is a set of files that controls how

The following list outlines the elements of a template:

- [Sideboxes](/user/template/sideboxes) - narrow pieces of content that are placed on the left and right edges of all pages
- [Centerboxes](/user/template/centerboxes) - wide pieces of content that are placed in the center of the page on specific pages 
- [Stylesheet](http://localhost:1313/user/template/stylesheet/) - the CSS that controls the layout of the site 
- [Responsiveness](/user/template/mobile_mode/) - modern templates must look good on mobile devices like phones and tablets
