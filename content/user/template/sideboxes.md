Sideboxes are narrow pieces of content that are displayed on the left and right side of the screen in the Zen Cart storefront in a desktop view.  (The smaller width of a mobile screen means they are put in the middle of the screen on such devices.)

Zen Cart has a number of [built in sideboxes](/user/sideboxes/sidebox_list); other sideboxes are available in the [sideboxes section of the Zen Cart plugins library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=12).  For example, the [Blank Sidebox](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=80) allows you to create your own sidebox with whatever content you wish. 

You can learn about [controlling sideboxes in the admin](/user/admin/sideboxes/) so that you only display the sideboxes that are most important to your store. 

The Information Sidebox, for example, is just a list of links. 
The Specials Sidebox, on the other hand, shows product images and information.

You can see all the available sideboxes in the [sidebox list](/user/sideboxes/sidebox_list/) FAQ. 

### Sideboxes and Mobile 

Responsive templates often not display sideboxes on a mobile device (especially a phone) due to space limitations.  Instead the links provided by sideboxes may be accessed from the hamburger menu at the top of the site. 

<img alt="Mobile - closed" src="/images/mobile_closed.png" width="50%" />

When you click on the hamburger icon at the top left, then menu opens 

<img alt="Mobile - open" src="/images/mobile_open.png" width="50%" />

From there you can navigate to the desired page.
