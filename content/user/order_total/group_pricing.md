If you want to offer a group discount, you need to first enable group pricing

Go to: [Admin > Modules > Order Total](/user/admin_pages/modules/order_total/) and select Group Pricing (ot_group_pricing).   
If it's not already installed, click Install to enable it.  

## Group Discounts

Go to [Admin > Customers > Group Pricing](/user/admin_pages/customers/group_pricing/). 

Next, you create a pricing group by clicking *Insert*.  (Or *Edit* to edit an existing pricing group.)  
Fill in the details.  

## Assigning Customers to Groups 

Go to [Admin > Customers > Customers](/user/admin_pages/customers/customers/) and find the customer you want to 
add to a group.  Edit the customer, and set the *Discount Pricing Group*
field at the bottom of the screen.  Press *Update*.

The customer will now be entitled to the Group Discount you have 
configured.  The discount will be shown as a line item 
under the Subtotal at checkout time.
