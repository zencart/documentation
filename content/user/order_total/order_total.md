Order Total modules allow you to add a surcharge or a discount to the order.

The list of available order total modules may be seen by going to [Admin > Modules > Order Total](/user/admin_pages/modules/order_total/).

Zen Cart has a number of built-in order total modules which allow you to 
increase or reduce the total owed based on various factors in the order.
*Increasing* the total is done using [fees](/user/order_total/default_fees/). 
*Reducing* the total is done using discounts like these: 

* Coupons - Create discount coupons for price reductions and free shipping 
* Group Discount - Offer discounts to groups of customers

All the line items in an order below the cart contents are order totals.
This means the Sub-Total, Tax, Shipping, and Total are displayed via order total modules. 

Zen Cart also offers a number of order total plugins, both fees and discounts: 

- [Gift Wrapping](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=267)
- [Better Together](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=201)
- [Quantity Discounts](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=135)

More order total plugins may be found in the [Other Modules section of the Plugins Library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=7).

Developers wishing to create an order total module should see the [order total dev FAQs](/dev/code/modules/).
