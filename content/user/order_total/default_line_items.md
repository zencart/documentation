The basic order total line items, which are enabled by default and will show for most taxable orders, are as follows: 

```
Subtotal:
Shipping:
Tax:
Total: 
```

The entries for subtotal, tax and total have no configuration other than sort order. 

Order total shipping has additional configuration settings which allow the configuration of free shipping (optionally over a threshold, and optionally limited to national and/or international). 

There are also [discounts](/user/order_total/order_total/) and [fees](/user/order_total/default_fees/) which can be added to an order.
