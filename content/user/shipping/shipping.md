Shipping modules allow you to charge your customers for delivery. 

The list of available shipping modules may be seen by going to [Admin > Modules > Shipping](/user/admin_pages/modules/shipping/).

Zen Cart has a number of built-in shipping modules which allow you to charge for shipping based on various factors in the order: 

- Flat - Charge a single flat rate on all shipments
- Item - Charge per item
- Zones - Charge different rates for delivering to different zones 
- Table - Charge according to a table of rates based on weight, item count or item price
