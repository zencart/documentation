Preamble worth reading: [How-do-I-rebuild-my-site-on-the-new-version-instead-of-upgrading](https://www.zen-cart.com/entry.php?3-How-do-I-rebuild-my-site-on-the-new-version-instead-of-upgrading). 

Before you begin, remember to make a [complete backup of your files and database](/user/running/backup/). 

## 3 EASY STEPS TO UPGRADE ZEN CART

**NOTE:** For each new release, there are important documents in the [/docs](https://www.zen-cart.com/docs/) folder of the Zen Cart zip file.  Please check this folder for any special notes about the version you are upgrading from/to.

This guide assumes for simplicity that you have Zen Cart installed in a folder called `store`.  This configuration allows you to run your old store and your new store side by side for testing before going live.  If you didn't install your current store in a subfolder, you can still install your new store in a subfolder for testing, and then remove the subfolder and install at the top level when it's time to go live. 


## Getting Started 

This is a basic guide to upgrading Zen Cart. If you have not yet installed Zen Cart, please see the [/docs/1.readme_installation.html](https://www.zen-cart.com/docs/1.readme_installation.html) file for installation instructions.  

Upgraders, be sure to familiarize yourself with the content of the release (and any prior releases you are upgrading through to get to the new release).  

You should review:

- Relevant **What's New** files in the [release directory docs](https://www.zen-cart.com/docs/). 
- The [Release Specific Considerations](/user/upgrading/release_specific_upgrade_considerations/) document. 

To upgrade Zen Cart, you'll need the same basic tools you used to install and customize it in the first place: An [FTP tool](/user/first_steps/useful_tools/#ftp-tools), a [text editor](/user/first_steps/useful_tools/#php-html-and-text-editors) for HTML/PHP code, phpMyAdmin or equivalent access to your MySQL database, and your Control Panel for managing your webspace.  

Additionally, you will find a file-comparison tool to be highly beneficial.  See the list of [Useful Tools](/user/first_steps/useful_tools/) for suggestions.  While the free tools offer 2-way comparison, the more advanced paid-for tools offer 3-way comparisons which can be much handier.

Upgrading follows 3 core steps. We suggest you take your time going through each stage carefully and methodically. Don't rush the process. And as always, be sure you keep good backups first.

You should also spend some time getting familiar with additions to the demo data in the new version, so that you can become comfortable with the many new features contained in the new release.  

## Compatibility

First, [check whether your server is compatible](/user/first_steps/server_requirements/) with the version you're trying to upgrade to.

## 0\. New version familiarization (optional) 

This step is helpful if you have never done this before, to give you more confidence in creating databases and uploading files.

It's also helpful just to take a tour of the new version to see how any new features work.

Install it, just like a fresh store: Unzip a copy of the new version of Zen Cart, upload it to your webserver into a `demo` folder.  Create a new demo database in cPanel, when you install the new version of Zen Cart, set it to use the new demo database.  Be sure to include the Demo products when you install. This is just for a place for you to play with the new version and get used to its new features. These can be deleted after conversion is complete.  

Study the new features, and the documented changes to the template structures, as well as the "changelog". Use the demo products in the demo shop as examples. See also the supporting documentation provided with the new release.  

When you're done with your testing, remove `demo` and the database you created for it.

## 1\. Preparation

### Make backups
Make a [full backup of your live database (dump to SQL file)](/user/running/backup/#b-backup-your-database). Store this file on your PC for later reference.

Make a [full backup of your live site files (ftp to your PC and zip it up for safe-keeping)](/user/running/backup/#a-backup-your-files). 

Keep an unzipped copy of your backup on your PC to use in the next steps. Perhaps call this folder `store`. 

### Make a list of all your existing customizations
**NOTE:** This is a time-consuming step.

Now let's find out the differences/customizations between your site and the original Zen Cart files.  (You can find older versions here: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files/))

> Advanced Tip: You will probably discover that combining the following "discovery of customizations" with the "execution" step will save you time. This document is written with the assumption that you're using only a 2-way-capable comparison tool. If you have a 3-way compare tool things will go much faster: column 1 is `zc_orig`, column 2 is `store` and column 3 is `zc_new` ... and you merge (copy) any changes between columns 2-3 into column 2 where they don't clash with column 1. Anything changed between columns 1-2 is a customization you made or a plugin has made, so you want to keep that or at least merge it with whatever is new in column 3 if anything. This sounds complicated when just reading it in words, but in practice it becomes visually quite intuitive.

You may already have a list, but during this step make a list of any add-ons/plugins you have installed, for later reference. You will use this list to get updates for those plugins later. You may find that you remember additional plugins to add to this list as you do the review in the next paragraphs.

Unzip a copy of the original Zen Cart files for the version you _originally installed_ or last upgraded from (ie: perhaps v1.3.9 or even 1.5.1). This should be placed in a separate working folder on your PC (perhaps 
`zen_orig`).

Run a tool like [WinMerge](http://winmerge.sf.net/) to compare the "Original" Zen Cart files in `zen_orig` against your current live store files in `store`. 

Here we are taking a list of how your actual site is customized vs the original files.
Make note of all the files that are "different", and how.
In WinMerge you can double-click on each file and note what the differences are.

#### Types of Differences
There will be many differences:

- language defines for display text - those will be simple to carry forward.
- actual programming/code differences -- for these you will need to make detailed notes in order to carry over those changes to the new version.
- add-ons/plugins you've installed -- these often contain numerous programming changes, and may not be fully compatible with the newer Zen Cart release.

Your list of add-ons/plugins may help you narrow down the source of any differences you're finding between versions. You may have to download the add-on again to take a look at the readme or code contained in it. An updated version may already be posted, or you may have to contact the author to ask for an updated version.

#### Consider moving customizations into a standard override structure
As you make your list of changed files, this may be a good time to move your store-specific changes into the Zen Cart template-override structure, if you haven't already done so. See the [Template System Documentation](/user/template/) for help on the template system.

The benefit of moving these customizations into specific override files is that these overrides are simpler to compare/upgrade in the future, and may mean less work when it comes to the "actual" upgrade in following steps.


## 2\. Execution

Download and unzip the latest Zen Cart version to your PC. This will be in a 3rd directory (perhaps `store_new`), separate from the other two folders compared above (eg `store` and `zen_orig`).

Using the list of files you made earlier, go through each "changed" file, and re-make your changes from the old version onto the new version.  

- Simple language edits will be just a matter of copy-and-paste.

- Programming changes to core components will be more difficult and require significant testing.  

  You may sometimes find WinMerge handy at this stage to apply edits as well. However, you will see many extra differences that may not be related to your own customizations, or that may conflict. Be careful making changes to program code.  

- Note that there will be several changes you will have to make to files that you have overridden using the template overrides system. Thus, you'll want to compare files from 
`/includes/templates/MYTEMPLATE/*` to `/includes/template/template_default/*`, and the same with language file overrides, sideboxes, etc.

  While sometimes it may seem that the overrides files mean double work, it's still very useful to know that most of your non-override files won't require special attention, and you can focus your work on mainly the override files. (Again, this assumes you've diligently used overrides.)

- Install updated versions of plugins. This includes installing the files, and doing any installation/upgrade steps their documentation mentions. If database updates are required, do them. Also make detailed notes of these steps you take so you can re-do them on your live store when it comes time to do the real upgrade with real data.

- For any plugins/addons you are no longer using, do any uninstall instructions associated with them, including removing their files and removing any database components. If some of this can be done to your "live" site before actually going "live" then sometimes this makes the go-live step simpler.


## 3\. Testing

### Take a fresh backup
First, take a fresh database backup from your live store.

In your live store, go to `Admin > Configuration > Website Maintenance`.  Put the store in maintenance mode, and add your IP to the list in the `Down For Maintenance (exclude this IP-Address)` field.

Make a fresh backup of your live database. 

Put your site back into normal mode (turn off Down For Maintenance).

### Create a temporary new store on your server, for testing

Create a NEW database in cPanel. Use the backup that you just made from your live site to fill the database with data. (See [restoring the database](/user/running/backup/#to-restore-your-database).)

### Prepare the configure.php files

On your PC, in your `store_new` folder, copy 

- `includes/dist-configure.php` to `includes/configure.php`
- `admin/includes/dist-configure.php` to `admin/includes/configure.php`

Edit these two files and set all the parameters, using your existing live store as a guide.
Remember to specify your NEW database when filling in `DB_DATABASE`. 

### Upload the files to a temporary directory on your server
Upload the files from your modified `store_new` (created in step 2) into a temporary directory on your server, perhaps called `store_new`.


### Run zc_install to upgrade the temporary database
In your browser, run `store_new/zc_install/index.php` and choose "_Upgrade_" when prompted. (Don't select "Clean Install", or you will overwrite your database.) 
![Use the upgrade button!](/images/upgrade_button.png)

If the "Upgrade" button does not appear, then the installer was unable to connect to your database to determine its version. Check your configure.php settings and be sure the `DB_*` fields correspond to your new database, including that the DB_PREFIX matches the DB_PREFIX in your old site.

Run any install/upgrade steps for any plugins you've installed/upgraded. And removals for any plugins you're removing.

### Test the temporary new store
Test your customizations. Edit as needed. Compare with the test/demo install performed earlier, as needed.

When satisfied that all is OK, go live.  


### Going Live

#### Put your store down-for-maintenance again
Use the same step from earlier.

#### Take a fresh database backup
Same step from earlier. This is for safekeeping, and in case anything goes badly wrong.

#### Go live
To go live, do the following: 

- look at the live `store` folder's `/includes/configure.php` file and note the DB_DATABASE name.
- rename your live `store` folder to `store_old`.
- rename `store_new` to `store`. 
- Edit the `includes/configure.php` and `admin/includes/configure.php` files to:
  - change the folder references from `store_new` to `store`
  - change the DB_DATABASE name to match the OLD database

  > You're using the "old" DB_DATABASE name here, because you're actually going to keep using the REAL database, so you don't lose any data.

> Remember that your "configure.php" files on your server are typically set to read-only, and thus in order to upload them will require that you mark those files read-write before uploading.  Be sure to put them back to read-only after uploading.

- Run zc_install again to upgrade the database (because now you're using the real database)
- Re-run any plugin installation/removal scripts just like you did for the temporary testing

#### Verify

Test the store to be sure that things are operating as desired. 

If you have small problems to repair, turn "Down for maintenance" on and off again as necessary.  

# Example Scenario:

Suppose you are currently running Zen Cart 1.5.1 and you want to upgrade to 
Zen Cart 1.5.6c.  These are the steps to use (we will skip over the New code familiarization step).


- Download your live store files, and put them in a folder called `store`.
- Download a fresh copy of Zen Cart 1.5.1, and put it in a folder called `zen_orig`.
- Compare the files in `store` to the files in `zen_orig`, noting your changes. 
- Download a fresh copy of Zen Cart 1.5.6c, and put it in a folder called `store_new`. Apply the changes you found in the prior step to `store_new`.

> If using a 3-way compare tool, the two bullet-points above can be combined into one, so the 3-way-compare tool can visually empower you to do the copying of changes necessary.

- In `store_new`, create the new configure files: 
    - copy `includes/dist-configure.php` to `includes/configure.php`
    - copy `admin/includes/dist-configure.php` to `admin/includes/configure.php`
    - modify these two files, setting the values in them from your original configure files in `store`.  
    - In each file, you want two changes: `DIR_FS_CATALOG` setting should refer to `store_new` and not `_store`, and `DB_DATABASE` should refer to a new database name, not the original one (since we're only testing at this point).

- Upload `store_new` to your server.  
- Make a fresh backup of your live database. 
- Create a NEW database in cPanel, using the new DB_DATABASE name you used in the last step of updating your configuration files. Fill this database from the backup that you just made.
- point your browser to `store_new/zc_install`, which will take you through the database update process.
- do any install/remove steps relevant to any addons you're adding/removing
- test `store_new`, going through the shopping, buying and order fulfillment process.
- When you're ready to go live, do the following: 
  - take a final backup of your live store database for safekeeping
  - In your live store, go to `Admin > Configuration > Website Maintenance`. Put the store in maintenance mode, and add your IP to the list in the `Down For Maintenance (exclude this IP-Address)` field.
  - rename your live store folder to `store_old`.
  - rename `store_new` to `store`.  Edit the `includes/configure.php` and `admin/includes/configure.php` files to change the `DIR_FS_CATALOG` references from `store_new` to `store`, and change the `DB_DATABASE` references back to the original database name.
  - run the `store/zc_install` process to upgrade your live database.
  - do any install/remove steps relevant to any addons you're adding/removing
  - You're now LIVE!
  - test your upgrade 
  - take your store out of maintenance mode so customers can use it again

## Plugin Considerations

In the description above, we assume the changes you have made are things like language file changes or maybe small code tweaks you did.  If the changes are plugins, there may be a better way than just porting the old changes forward to the new version: you can check the [Plugins Library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php) for an updated version of the plugin.  If you don't see one, you can ask on the plugin's support thread.


## Templates

When it comes to templates, if you have gotten your template from the Plugins Library, the advice above applies. If your template came from a commercial vendor, you should approach that vendor and ask about an upgrade.

If you are upgrading from 1.5.4 or below, you have another decision to make: Zen Cart 1.5.5 and above are designed to be used on mobile devices as well as desktop devices.  Your older template is likely not mobile friendly, so you may wish to get one that is.  The built in [responsive classic](/user/template/other_templates/#responsive-classic-template-product-page) template in 1.5.5+ is a good start.
