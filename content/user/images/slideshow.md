There are slideshow plugins if you wish to show a rotating gallery of images on your home page: 

- [ZX Slideshow](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1404) 
- [Nivo Slider](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1381)

Generally slideshows make use of [Banner Manager](/user/admin_pages/tools/banner_manager) to load and organize images.  See the documentation provided by each plugin for details.
