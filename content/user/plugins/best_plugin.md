"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder," as the saying goes.  Ten users will
have ten different opinions about what's important.  

Look through the [Plugin Directory](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php). If you find something that appeals to you, here are some next steps:

- On the plugin's own page, click the orange 
<img src="/images/support_thread.png" alt="Forum Support Thread" style="height: 30px !important;" /> Forum Support Thread button, and browse the support thread for the plugin.  Is the thread active?  Is the plugin still supported? 

- Download the plugin and take a look at the README file.  Many plugins are easy 
to install - see [how to install a plugin](/user/plugins/how_to_install_a_plugin/).  If it looks too complicated 
or there are too many steps, place an ad on the [Commercial Help Wanted forum](/user/zen_cart_forum/chw/) to hire a pro to do it for you. 

### Plugins and the Zen Cart Core

- Sometimes a plugin is so popular, it becomes part of Zen Cart!  In the 1.3.X days, a feature called **Admin Profiles** feature was created 
to allow storeowners to create subsets of capabilities for their staff 
when full admin access was not desired.  This feature was pulled in to 
Zen Cart core in the 1.5.0 release, and it's now under the [Admins menu](/user/admin_pages/admins/). 

    Similarly, 

- Zen Cart 1.5.7 includes a 
number of popular and powerful plugins from the user community, 
including **Default Attribute**, **Report All Errors**, **Ask a Question**, **Sortable Orders Status**, and **zenNonCAPTCHA**. 
- In Zen Cart 1.5.6, **Sales Reports with Graphs** was migrated from a plugin to a core feature. 
- In Zen Cart 1.5.5, **myDEBUG log backtrace** was migrated from a plugin to a core feature.

However, even though a plugin is popular, there's no guarantee 
it will be pulled into the core  There are good reasons for [keeping some plugins separate from the Zen Cart core](/user/plugins/why_plugins/).
