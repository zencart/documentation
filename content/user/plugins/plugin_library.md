The Zen Cart forum hosts the [Plugins Library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php), where open source contributions to Zen Cart may be obtained.

These plugins are supported on the Zen Cart forum by volunteers.

If you are a developer who'd like to submit a plugin, take a look at the [developer's plugin help](/dev/plugins/rules/) for guidance.
