<!-- RELEASETIME - update --> 

[Release Announcements](https://www.zen-cart.com/forumdisplay.php?2-Zen-Cart-Release-Announcements) are provided on the Zen Cart forum. 

[Security Patches](/user/about_us/security_releases/) are also announced on the forum. 

See also [Zen Cart Database Schema](/dev/schema/), 
[Zen Cart Known Bugs](/user/about_us/known_bugs/), 
and
[PHP version compatibility with Zen Cart](/user/first_steps/server_requirements/#php-version). 

If you need to get a copy of Zen Cart (current or older version), please see [Downloading Zen Cart](/user/first_steps/get_zen_cart/).

The version numbering system for Zen Cart has changed starting with 2.0.0, please see [Zen Cart Versioning](/user/about_us/versioning/) for details.

Prior to version 2.0.0, Zen Cart Releases were either full releases and patch releases.

Full releases contain more feature content and file changes, and may modify the database; patch releases do not modify the database.  Upgrading to a patch release from a full release (or from a prior patch release) is also simpler due to the smaller number of changes.

This is the release history of the Zen Cart product.

Zen Cart 2.0.0 is a work in progress, to be released later in early 2024.
