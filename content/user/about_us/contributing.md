There are many ways you can help the project. 

- You can answer user questions on [the Zen Cart forum](https://www.zen-cart.com/forum.php).

- You can work on fixing bugs or adding features for the next release.  The [Zen Cart code](https://github.com/zencart/zencart) is stored in Github to make it easy for people to contribute, and the [guide to contributing](/dev/contributing/) helps new people get started.

- Do you speak other languages?  You could [create a language pack](/dev/languages/creating_a_language_pack/).

- You can file bug reports on the [issues list](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/issues) in Github, or on the [bug report sub-forum](https://www.zen-cart.com/forumdisplay.php?140-Bug-Reports). 

- You can work on documentation.  The [Zen Cart documentation](https://github.com/zencart/documentation) is also stored in Github.  A [getting started guide](https://github.com/zencart/documentation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) is provided. 
- You can create a new plugin, or adopt a plugin that has been abandoned. You can [read about plugins](/dev/plugins/) to get started. 

- You can make a [financial donation](/user/about_us/donate/) to support the project. 

The other thing you can do is to *gently correct* people who say "Zen Cart is dead" or "Zen Cart is obsolete" or "Zen Cart is just osCommerce with templates."  None of these things is true!  In fact, Zen Cart is an [active project on Github](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/graphs/contributors) with [many unique features](/user/about_us/features/).  It has a [busy support forum](https://www.zen-cart.com/forum.php) and gets [new releases every year or so](/user/about_us/release_history/).  Best of all, it can be easily [extended to meet your custom needs](/user/plugins/).  No platform is ideal for everyone, but for many use cases, Zen Cart is an excellent fit.
