There are many things you can do to change the appearance of your cart. 

### Language file changes 
You can change any string in your cart by 
using [overrides](/user/first_steps/overrides/) to 
customize the language file which contains that string. 

### Templating
You can completely change the appearance of your site, or just any one 
page, using the [template system](/user/template/). 

### Stylesheets 
Stylesheets control visual aspects of your site, such  as font choices,
colors and text sizes.  You can [customize stylesheets](/user/template/stylesheet/) as part 
of your template. 

### Adding Pages
You have several options for [adding a new page](/user/customizing/add_pages/) to your cart.
