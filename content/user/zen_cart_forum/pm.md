## What is a PM? 

The Zen Cart forum software offers the capability for users to message each other. This feature is called  private messaging or PM. 

## What are the rules of PM? 
Private messages are subject to the [Zen Cart Code of Conduct](/user/zen_cart_forum/code_of_conduct/).  The [do's and don'ts list](/user/zen_cart_forum/dos_and_donts/) also provides some guidance. 

## How do I send a PM? 
In the forum, if you right click on someone's avatar, you get a popup menu.
One of the entries is "Private Message".  Click on that.
