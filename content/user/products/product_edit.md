### Editing a Product 

[Adding a product](/user/products/product_management_admin/#adding-a-product) and editing that product are performed on the same screen. 

The product edit screen shows you the master category id value for a product, which tells you the category the product is in. 

![Master Category for a product](/images/master_category.png)

If the product is a [linked product](/user/products/linked_product/) it will have other category associations, which can be managed in the [Products to Categories](/user/admin_pages/catalog/products_to_categories/) page.

The product edit screen also allows you to set the product's fields.
See [adding a product](/user/products/product_management_admin/#adding-a-product) for more details. 


### Deleting a Product 
Deleting a product removes it from  the catalog entirely. 
Deleting a product is done from the [Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/) screen using the trash can icon.
