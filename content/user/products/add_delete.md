### How do I add a new product?

Go to [Admin > Catalog > Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/).  Drill down to the level where you want to add the product.  

There must either be other products there or nothing - a category which 
already contains categories may not contain products. 

Click the new product button.

On the next page fill in the product name, price, and other fields, and click *Preview*.  Then on the next page, click *Insert*. 

After creating the product, if you need to [add attributes](/user/products/attributes/) to it, 
click the light blue *A* to the right of the product. 


### How do I delete a product? 

Go to [Admin > Catalog > Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/).  Drill down to the level where you see the product.  

Click the red trash can icon on the right side of the page.

From the next page, choose *Delete*. 

### EasyPopulate 

Rather than create products through the admin panel, some storeowners prefer to import CSV files containing product information using a tool like [EasyPopulate](/user/products/easypopulate/).
