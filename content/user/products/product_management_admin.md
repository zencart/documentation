### Product Types and Product Fields 
The fields that are shown on the product adding/editing page in admin
 depend on the [product type](/user/admin_pages/catalog/product_types/).  In these examples, we'll assume the 
product type is `Product - General`.  This is the most common (and default) product type. 


### Adding a Product

Adding a product allows you to set all the product fields available to 
that product type.  Adding is done on the 
[product add/edit screen](/user/products/product_edit/). 

For more information, see the [product FAQs](/user/products/). 

### Editing a Product 

[Editing a product](/user/products/product_edit/) is done on the same screen as adding a product. 

The product edit screen shows you the master category id value for a product, which tells you the category the product is in.

If the product is a [linked product](/user/products/linked_product/) it will have other category associations, which can be managed in the [Products to Categories](/user/admin_pages/catalog/products_to_categories/) page.

The product edit screen also allows you to set the product's fields.
See [adding a product](/user/products/product_management_admin/#adding-a-product) for more details. 


### Deleting a Product 
Deleting a product removes it from  the catalog entirely. 
Deleting a product is done from the [Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/) screen using the trash can icon.

### Moving a Product 
Moving a product changes its master category so it appears in another place.
Moving a product is done from the [Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/) screen using the purple M icon.

### Copying a Product 

Copying a product can be used to create a duplicate of the original product or create a [linked product](/user/products/linked_product/). 
Copying a product is done from the [Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/) screen using the blue C icon.

See [Products Meta Tags Editor](/user/admin_pages/catalog/products_meta_tags_editor/).
