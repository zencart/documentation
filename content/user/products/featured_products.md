[Featured Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/featured/) allow you to highlight 
products for display in various places. 

Once you have created some featured products, Zen Cart has a number of ways for you to show them off: 

- the built in Featured Products page, which appears when you navigate to `YOURSITE.com/index.php?main_page=featured_products`.
- the optional Featured Products [Sidebox](/user/template/sideboxes/) 
- the optional Featured Products [Centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes/)

You may also configure featured products to appear in the following places: 

- on an empty shopping cart page with the setting on [Admin > Configuration > Stock](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_stock/)
- below a [product listing](/user/products/product_listing/) using the settings on [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/)

Adding a product to the featured products list is done on the [Admin > Catalog > Featured Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/featured/) page.
