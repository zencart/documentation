Zen Cart uses the term "product listing page" to refer to a page that shows a number of products (versus the [product info](/user/products/product_info/) page, which shows only a single product).

Examples of listing pages are: 

- All Products
- Featured Products
- New Products
- Special Products
- Category Listings 

These pages are built in to Zen Cart; no extra work is required to create them.

The layout for product listing pages is described in [listing page layout](/user/template/listing_page_layout/).
