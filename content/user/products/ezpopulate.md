### EZPopulate 

Rather than enter products one-by-one in the admin panel, some storeowners prefer to use tools that will import a CSV containing product information.  One such tool is called EZPopulate (or Easy Populate).   

You can find [EZPopulate in the Plugins Library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2069).
