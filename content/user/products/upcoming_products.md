Upcoming Products are those whose Date Available setting on the 
[product editing page](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/) is set to a date in the future. 

If you have created upcoming products, Zen Cart allows you to show them 
in a [Centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes)
on the main page called Upcoming Products.  This can be configured with the setting *Show Upcoming Products on Main Page* in [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/) setting. 

You may also configure upcoming products to appear in the following places: 

- in a centerbox on an empty shopping cart page with the setting *Show Upcoming Products on Main Page* on [Admin > Configuration > Stock](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_stock/)
- in a centerbox below a [product listing page](/user/products/product_listing/) using the settings on [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/)

FIXME new behavior in 1.5.7 for upcoming needs to be documented
