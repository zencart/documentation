Once you have created downloadable products, or after you have updated them, you'll want to check on them to be sure they will work for your customers.  There are a couple of ways to do this. It is also particularly important to do this if you [move the download folder](/user/security/relocate_download_folder/) for security reasons. 

### Downloads Manager 
Going to [Admin > Catalog > Downloads Manager](/user/admin_pages/catalog/downloads_manager/) shows a screen with the first download (test.zip) missing.

### Attributes Controller 

Going to [Admin > Catalog > Attributes Controller](/user/admin_pages/catalog/attributes_controller) and viewing a single product which has downloads allows you to see if the downloadable files are present where they shoule be. 
In the image below, you can see again that the file test.zip is missing.
