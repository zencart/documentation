### Adding a Category 

Adding a category allows you to set all the fields which describe the category.

The categories add/edit screen allows you to:

- set the category name and description
- set the category image
- set the category sort order 
- restrict new product additions to the category to only specific product types if desired.  See [Product Type Restrictions](/user/products/category_product_type_restrict/). 

For more information, see the [category FAQs](/user/products/). 

### Editing a Category

[Adding a category](/user/products/category_management_admin/#adding-a-category) and editing that category are performed on the same screen. 

### Deleting a Category 
Deleting a category removes it from  the catalog entirely. 
Deleting a category is done from the [Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/) screen using the trash can icon. 

It is best to remove or move any sub-categories or products under a category you are about to delete.
