### How do I change the "Welcome Guest" message?

If you want to eliminate “Welcome Guest! Would you like to log yourself in?” message completely, turn off the Customer Greeting in your 
[Admin > Configuration > Layout settings](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_layoutsettings/).  Go to *Customer Greeting - Show on Index Page* and set it to 0.

If you want to replace this message with one of your own, 
edit the file 
`includes/languages/english/YOURTEMPLATE/index.php`, 
and locate these lines of code:

```
if (STORE_STATUS == '0') {
   define('TEXT_GREETING_GUEST', 'Welcome <span class="greetUser">Guest!</span> Would you like to <a href="%s">log yourself in</a>?');
} else {
   define('TEXT_GREETING_GUEST', 'Welcome, please enjoy our online showcase.');
}
define('TEXT_GREETING_PERSONAL', 'Hello <span class="greetUser">%s</span>!');
```

As you can see, there are two Welcome messages depending upon whether you wish Zen Cart to be a fully functioning store, or just a showroom.

Edit the message starting from the word “Welcome” but be careful not to change the text in angled brackets, or the brackets themselves. Make sure that the single quote marks are not left out. If you want to include an apostrophe in your text e.g. “Lucy's Store”, you will need to put an escape character before the apostrophe, i.e. “Lucy\'s Store”.

Save the edited file and upload it to your server.

### How do I change the "Congratulations! you have successfully installed..." Message?

The default `Congratulations! You have successfully installed your Zen Cart; E-Commerce Solution` text is rendered as an `H1` tag in the site template's HTML code. It is a perfect opportunity to provide some rich SEO text related to your store/business. It is best to put something useful here, instead of merely deleting it.

To edit this important text, do the following:

Open the `includes/languages/english/index.php` file and find the following code:

```
  define('HEADING_TITLE', 'Congratulations! You have successfully installed your Zen Cart&reg; E-Commerce Solution.');
```

Replace the text starting “Congratulations” with your own text that is welcoming and describes your business. 

Make sure that the single quote marks at the beginning and end are not left out. If your text includes single-quotes (apostrophes) be sure to add a `\` before them to "escape" them for proper PHP syntax.

**NOTE: This line occurs twice, so be sure to replace both lines.**

Save the edited file to `includes/languages/english/YOURTEMPLATE/index.php` and upload it to your server.

### How do I change the "Sales Message Goes Here" or "Tagline Here" text?

To change the `Sales Message Goes Here` or `Tagline Here` text to say what you want, do the following: 

Open `includes/languages/english/header.php` in your text editor. Find the following line of code:

```
define('HEADER_SALES_TEXT', 'Tagline Here');
```

Replace `Tagline Here` with your own text, making sure that the single quote marks are not left out.

Save the edited file to `includes/languages/english/YOURTEMPLATE/header.php` and upload it to your server.

NB: By default, the text “Sales Message Goes Here” is also located in `includes/languages/english/header.php` 

```
define('HEADER_SALES_TEXT', 'Sales Message Goes Here');
```

### How do I turn off the listing of categories that goes across the top of my page?

These are called the *Category Tabs*, and can be switched off by going to [Admin > Configuration > Layout Settings](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_layoutsettings/) and setting *Categories-Tabs Menu ON/OFF* to zero.

### How do I remove the word "Home" in the middle column?

On some pages, to the right of the categories sidebox, the word "Home" (or perhaps "Home > some-category-name") appears above the page content. 

These are called the *breadcrumbs* (think Hansel and Gretel).  They show where you are and how to get back to previous locations. You can either turn them off completely or you can turn them off only on the main page. Although breadcrumbs may look a little odd on your home page, they can very useful to your users as they go deeper into your site.  

To turn them off, go to [Admin > Configuration > Layout settings](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_layoutsettings/) and set *Define Breadcrumb Status* to 0.
