**Example 1**: I want to display the featured sidebox on my front page only, and suppress it from all other pages.

Create an over-ride for the sidebox's module file. For the featured products sidebox, this would involve copying includes/modules/sideboxes/featured_products.php to includes/modules/sideboxes/YOURTEMPLATE/featured_products.php.  

Open up your new sidebox module file and take a look at the code. 
Generally it will look something like this  

```
<?php  

BIG COMMENT BLOCK  

// test if box should display  
  $show_featured= true;  

  if ($show_featured == true) {  

    // MAIN PROCESSING BLOCK  

  }  
?>
```

All we need to do is to change the line that reads  

```
$show_featured= true;
```

into  

```
  if ($this_is_home_page) {  
    $show_featured = true;  
  } else {  
    $show_featured = false;  
  }
```

If your sidebox module doesn't have a conditional such as 
`if ($show_featured == true) { ... } ` wrapped around the code, then just add it (changing the variable name to something suitable and unique for your sidebox to avoid unintentionally turning off other sideboxes).

**Example 2**: I do not want to display any sideboxes on the checkout pages. 

Modify the file `includes/templates/YOURTEMPLATE/common/tpl_main_page.php`.

Add this after the comment block at the top of the file: 

```
if (in_array($current_page_base,explode(",",'checkout_shipping,checkout_payment,checkout_confirmation,checkout_success')) ) {
  $flag_disable_right = true;
  $flag_disable_left = true;
}
```

**Example 3**: I want all the sideboxes on the right removed.

Turning off each of the sideboxes set to display on the right in 
[Admin > Tools > Layout Boxes Controllers](/user/admin_pages/tools/layout_boxes_controller/) is not enough.  You need to reclaim the space by going to 
[Admin > Configuration > Layout Settings](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_layoutsettings/) and  setting *Column Right Status - Global* to 0.
