Older payment modules like `credit card` and `CEON Manual Card` are not recommended for the following reasons: 

- they are not PCI Compliant
- storing credit card details in your database means both the store owner and the customer at risk in the event of a breach. 
- in some countries it is no longer legal to do this
- it could be a violation of your merchant agreement
