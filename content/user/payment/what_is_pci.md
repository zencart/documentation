The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an information security standard for organizations that handle credit cards.  The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud.

The PCI Standard is run by a standards body called the [Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). 

Zen Cart is designed to be compliant with PCI DSS standards, but you will need to certify your own installation (with all the changes you have made and plugins you have installed) in order to claim PCI compliance.  Many vendors have emerged in this space claiming to offer compliance tests; not all are legitimate.  You should work with your hoster to find a suitable testing firm.
