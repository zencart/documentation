Here are some common Square errors and the steps required to fix them. 

--- 

###  The provided OAuth access token has expired. You must renew the access token via the Renew Access Token endpoint. 

**Situation:**  
Customer is attempting to complete a purchase and paying via Square. They login, provide payment details, and click the Continue button, and they are shown this message. 

**Action to Resolve:** 

1. Open Square in your Zen Cart Admin by going to Admin > Modules > Payment > Square WebPay and clicking Edit.  Be sure to click Edit before going further. 

1. Go to [https://connect.squareup.com/apps](https://connect.squareup.com/apps), click "Sign In" and open the app you are using for payment. 

1. Click the OAuth link on the left, then click the "Replace secret" button.

1. Click "Show" on the Application secret, and paste it into your Zen Cart Admin. 

If you forgot to click Edit in the first step, you likely have a blank screen on the right hand side of the page when you do click Edit.

Here's what to do if that happens: 

- Edit the URL in the address bar, which will end with 

```
&action=edit
```

Change this to 

```
&action=delete 
```

and press Enter.  Press the "Remove Module" button and remove Square WebPay.  Then re-add it using the [reinstall instructions](/user/payment/square/#reinstalling-square-web-payments).
