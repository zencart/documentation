Since 1.5.7, the site map page has included links to all EZ-Pages.

For users on an older release of Zen Cart, there is a contribution available from the Plugins Library which allows you to add EZ-Pages to your site map.  It is called [EZ-Pages on Sitemap](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=123).
