Salemaker is used to create a policy for reducing prices and then applying it to one or more categories. You would use this to set up a 20% off January Sale for example.

Specials allow you to target price reductions at individual products. You might use this to reduce the prices of end-of-line products, while not touching the prices of new stock that you're bringing in to replace them.

See [Salemaker](/user/admin_pages/catalog/salemaker/) and [Specials](/user/admin_pages/catalog/specials/).
