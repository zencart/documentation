[Email Archive Manager](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=101) is a contribution which allows you to view the emails sent by the cart within your Admin panel.  This can be useful in a number of situations: 

- You are modifying the HTML email templates or email construction logic and you want to quickly see both the text and HTMl emails 
- You need a log of the email your customer service staff are sending
- You want the historical record of emails that went out

To use the Email Archive Manager, you must enable email archiving in 
[Admin->Configuration->Email Options](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_emailoptions#email_archiving_active)
