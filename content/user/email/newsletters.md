Sending large numbers of emails (newsletters or other marketing content)
using [Send Email](/user/admin_pages/tools/send_email/) or 
[Newsletter Manager](/user/admin_pages/tools/newsletter/)
is not recommended.  Your server and hosting account probably don't allow for
mass quantities of broadcast emails, and doing so could cause you to be treated like a spammer. 

Instead, we recommend that you use an *Email Service Provider* to handle your
bulk emailing needs.  

### Exporting Email Addresses 
To export email addresses, use the [Email Address Exporter](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=6) plugin and use it to feed the emails into a 3rd-party provider.

### MailChimp
There are several alternatives for sending newsletters and mass marketing messages.
The best known service that has a free pricing level is MailChimp. 
With them you can send emails, generate reports, do automation and more. 
They offer a few pre-built templates and their free service is sufficient for most small sites. 
They also have paid features and now position themselves as a full marketing platform.

A [MailChimp Integration](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=425) plugin is available for Zen Cart. 


### Other Alternatives 
Other providers exist as well but have very limited free features or can be
expensive, or may not have integrations for Zen Cart. 
Constant Contact is a popular one.
