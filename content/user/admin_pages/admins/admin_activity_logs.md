Admin Activity Logs allows you to access the logging data which is 
created when actions are taken in the admin.  This can be used as a 
security audit or to figure out when an undesired change was made. 

You cannot directly view your admin activity logs on this page, but you
can export them as a CSV, and download the output to your own computer.

### Purging Logs

If you are receiving the message, "The Admin Activity Logs table has records over 2 months old and should be archived to conserve space" 

![Zen Cart Admin Activity Log button](/images/admin_activity_log.png) 

this is what you should do: 

a) Go to Admins > Admin Activity Logs.  Where it says, "Review or Export Logs," check the box that says "Save to file on server" and press the *Go* button
on the right.  This will save your logs to disk in case you need them for troubleshooting. 

b) At the bottom of the screen, press the *Reset* button.  This will
take you to the Admin Activity Log Manager manager page.  On this page, 
press *Reset* again to delete your logs.
