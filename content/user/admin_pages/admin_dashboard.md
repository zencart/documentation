The Admin Dashboard is your home page in the Zen Cart admin.  

It is structured to give you the maximum amount of information possible about 
your store one one page.  

Each of the boxes on the admin page under the menu is called a widget. 
Here's the statistics widget, as an example. 

<img src="/images/widget.png" alt="Widgets on home page" />

If you have specific things you'd like to monitor on your site, you
can build your own widget.  See [building an admin widget](/dev/code/widget) for details.
