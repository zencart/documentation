Coupons can be restricted in the following ways:

- not applying to specific products
- only applying to specific products 

### Creating a restriction - Only allow specific products 
First set a restriction on:
Top category DENY

Next, start adding the Categories and/or Products that are ALLOWED.

You can mix the Categories and Products on the restrictions. 

By setting the Top Category to DENY then you will only permit what has been added as an ALLOW to work with the Discount Coupon. 


### Creating a restriction - Allow all products except specified ones 
First set a restriction on:
Top category ALLOW 

Next, start adding the Categories and/or Products that are DENIED. 

You can mix the Categories and Products on the restrictions. 

By setting the Top Category to ALLOW then you will permit any product to work with the Discount Coupon except what has been added as a DENY. 

### Restriction Selection 

You may select items to be restricted in the following ways: 
- all products in a category
