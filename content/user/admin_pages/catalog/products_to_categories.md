This page allows you to manage the links between products and categories. 

All products have a master category id, which links a product to its parent category.  The master category value is shown in the [Product Editing screen](/user/products/product_edit/) at the top.

[Linked products](/user/products/linked_product/) have other category values, which are stored in the `products_to_categories` table in Zen Cart.  This screen gives you a friendly interface to that table.
