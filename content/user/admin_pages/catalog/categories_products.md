**Note:** If you are looking for the Categories screen showing categories, please [see this page](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories/). 

If you are at a level where the Categories screen only shows products, 
there are a set of action icons on the right.

<img src="/images/products_icons.png" alt="Product Listing Icons" style="height: 100px !important; float: right" /> 
<br clear="all" />

These icons allow you to:

- [edit a product](/user/products/product_edit/) - update all the fields for a product 
- [delete a product](/user/products/product_management_admin/#deleting-a-product) - remove a product from the catalog 
- [move a product](/user/products/product_management_admin/#moving-a-product) - change the product's parent category
- [copy a product](/user/products/product_management_admin/#copying-a-product) - duplicate the product or create a [linked product](/user/products/linked_product))
- use the [attributes controller](/user/admin_pages/catalog/attributes_controller/)
- use the [products price manager](/user/admin_pages/catalog/products_price_manager/)
- use the [meta tags editor](/user/admin_pages/catalog/products_meta_tags_editor).
