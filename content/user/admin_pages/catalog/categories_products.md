If you are at a level where the Categories screen only shows products, 
there are a set of action icons on the right.

<img src="/images/products_icons.png" alt="Product Listing Icons" style="height: 100px !important; float: right" /> 
<br clear="all" />

These icons allow you to:
- edit product 
- delete product 
- move product (change categories)
- copy product (duplicate or create [linked product](/user/products/linked_product))
- use the [attributes controller](/user/admin_pages/catalog/attributes_controller/)
- use the [products price manager](/user/admin_pages/catalog/products_price_manager/)
- use the [meta tags editor](/user/admin_pages/catalog/products_meta_tags_editor). 

Using the green pencil will put you on the product editing page, which is 
a key page for configuring your products. 

The product edit screen allows you to set the following values for a product:
