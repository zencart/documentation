This admin page allows you to see all  the products which have a 
*Date Available* set to a future date. From this page, you may 
edit any product in the list of expected products. 

The *Date Available* field is set on the [Product Editing screen](/user/products/product_edit/). 

Expected Products are sometimes also called **Upcoming Products**.
