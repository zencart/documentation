This page allows you to compose a newsletter or product notification 
email message to be sent to a customer or a group of customers.

If you have [HTML enabled](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_emailoptions/#enable_html_emails), you will be allowed to create the message in
both rich and plain text; otherwise, you will only be allowed to use plain text.
