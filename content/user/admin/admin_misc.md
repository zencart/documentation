### Why are there so many configuration settings in the admin? 

It's a balance - every setting in the admin is one more change you can make 
to your store without needing to modify code.  Zen Cart is designed to be
storeowner-friendly in the sense that you can customize your cart without
being a software developer.

We have attempted to mitigate the complexity of the admin by providing 
[documentation on the config settings](/user/admin_pages/configuration/). 
There's even a way to view [all configuration settings](/user/admin_pages/configuration/all/).

### What determines if a product is New?

There are settings in [Admin > Configuration > Maximum Values](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_maximumvalues/) to determine what "New Product" means: 

```
New Product Listing - Limited to ...
Limit the New Product Listing to
0= All Products
1= Current Month
7= 7 Days
14= 14 Days
30= 30 Days
60= 60 Days
90= 90 Days
120= 120 Days
```


ALTERNATIVE:
If, however, you wish to hand-pick which items show up, then turn OFF the *New Products* box, and use *Featured Products* instead.  See [Admin > Catalog > Featured Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/featured/) to pick the products.

### How do I get my store home page to open to a certain category?

Open the [Admin  >Configuration  >Layout Settings](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_layoutsettings/). 

Find "Main Page - Opens with Category"

Type in the category you wish to open to.

```
example: 25  or 3_10 or 24_41_79
```

Then press *Save*.

### How do I enable the "Customers Also Purchased" display?

1. You need to have purchases in your store first ... where customers bought "this" product along with "another" product.

2. Set: [Admin > Configuration > Product Info > Also Purchased Products Columns per Row](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productinfo/#also_purchased_products_columns_per_row). 

3. Set: [Admin > Configuration > Maximum Values >Also Purchased Products](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_maximumvalues/#also_purchased_products).

### Is there a way that I can check on what users with Admin access to my site are doing?

There isn't currently a Zen Cart page to do this, but each time an Admin page is called, the access date, admin ID, page accessed, page parameters and IP address are logged in the `admin_activity_log` table. The contents of this table can be viewed via database management tools such as `phpMyAdmin`.  The table may also be exported using [Admin > Admins > Admin Activity Logs](/user/admin_pages/admins/admin_activity_logs/).

### How do I use another currency instead of US Dollars?
See [how do I use another currency?](/user/localization/my_currency/) 

---

### How do I generate a report on banner advertising? 
Banner statistics are tracked on an ongoing basis. When you open [Admin > Tools > Banner Manager](/user/admin_pages/tools/banner_manager/), you can see the last 3 days' details on-screen.

For more information, under the "Action" column, you see a small white graph symbol. Click on that to view stats for day/month/year.
