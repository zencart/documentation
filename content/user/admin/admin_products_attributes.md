The Admin > Catalog > Categories/Products page shows products when you drill down to a category with products.  On the right hand side of each product row are a series of buttons, which are described in the [Categories/Products (Products Level)](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/) FAQ.

When the button for attributes ("A") is black, as it is on the top row, the product has no attributes. 

When it is not black, as shown on the bottom row, the product has one or more attributes.
