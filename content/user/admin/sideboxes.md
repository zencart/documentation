### Controlling Sideboxes in Admin 
[Sideboxes](/user/template/sideboxes/) are narrow pieces of content that are displayed on the left and right side of the screen in the Zen Cart storefront in a desktop view.  

Sideboxes display is controlled by [Admin > Tools > Layout Boxes Controller](/user/admin_pages/tools/layout_boxes_controller/). 

### Controlling Sideboxes in Other Ways 

You can turn sideboxes off on a per page basis by modifying your template.  See [suppressing sidebox display](/user/sideboxes/suppressing_sidebox_display/) for details. 

You can also [turn off the left and right columns](/user/template/left_right_columns/) where sideboxes display.  

The number of entries shown in each sidebox is sometimes controlled using settings from [Admin > Configuration > Maximum Values](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_maximumvalues/).  

For example: 

- The number of Special Products displayed is controlled by MAX_RANDOM_SELECT_SPECIALS. 
- The number of Featured Products displayed is controlled by MAX_RANDOM_SELECT_FEATURED_PRODUCTS. 
- The number of Reviews displayed is controlled by MAX_RANDOM_SELECT_REVIEWS.
