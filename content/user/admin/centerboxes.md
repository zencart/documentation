There is a "New Products for [insert month]" section on several pages, including Home Page, New-Products page, All-Products Page, (empty)Shopping Cart page, etc.  These sections are called "centerboxes".

There are several "sets" of settings for the Centerboxes.

When you go to [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/), you will see options like:

- Show New Products on Main Page
- Show Featured Products on Main Page
- Show Special Products on Main Page
- Show Upcoming Products on Main Page
    - Note: the values you set are the Sort Order of the Centerboxes 
    - Turn OFF by setting to 0 all of the ones you do NOT want to see displayed 

The same is true on other similar configuration menus under Admin > Configuration:

- [New Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_newlisting/)
- [Featured Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_featuredlisting/)
- [All Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_alllisting/) 

For setting up the Centerboxes of the Empty Shopping Cart, use the settings on the Admin > Configuration > Stock, you will see the settings for:

- Show New Products on Main Page
- Show Featured Products on Main Page
- Show Special Products on Main Page
- Show Upcoming Products on Main Page
