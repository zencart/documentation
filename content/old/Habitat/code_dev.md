# Code Development

The Habitat VM initially links a domain, `zen.local`, to a checkout of the Zen Cart® develop branch, unless you have customised the Habitat.local.yaml.

You should be able to just open a browser and enter the http://zen.local URL to see the site.
The directory that the code is stored in within the VM is shared to the habitat directory that was created earlier under the habitat/web/zen folder.

As this directory is shared with the virtual machine, you can edit the files locally in your favorite editor, and see the changes immediately reflected in your browser.

More information on managing your VM can be found on the Vagrant website.
