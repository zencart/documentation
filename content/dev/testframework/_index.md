This is documentation for the Zen Cart Test Framework.

The test framework resides within the not_for_release directory. This directory is only really available
if you `checkout` the Zen Cart code using git.

It is not available if you just download the Zen Cart code via a `release` link.

Running Zen Cart tests locally has the potential to override your Zen Cart database and destroy data.

@fixme documentation here is WIP.
