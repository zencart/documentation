We are now ready to tag the release.

You should already have a checkout of the release branch. Ensure this is up to date, especailly
as you will have merged the version stamping changes.

Now we tag the release 

`git tag v1.5.8-alpha` obviously replacing the release name as appropriate

`git push upstream --tags`

It may be that you may need to do some remedial commits at this point.

**For any new commits at this point, we should manually update headers as 
it is difficult to re-run the version stamper. You may also need to update `docs`
and your [Release Notes]({{< ref "release_notes" >}} "release notes") as well.**

If you have added extra commits you will need to update the release tag.

```
git tag -d v1.5.8-alpha
git push --delete upstream v1.5.8-alpha
git tag v1.5.8-alpha
git push upstream --tags
```

After this we then need to create the release on github.

By clicking on the ... on the right hand side we can create a release.

The title is usually the same name as the tag name.

The description should point the the https://docs.zen-cart.com release documentation.

Don't for get to mark it as a pre-release if necessary.
