# Class Autoloading

Encapsulated plugins allows you to Autoload classes based on 2 scenarios.

 - Where the class follows PSR4 and the the filename is the same as the class name
 - Where the filename is different to the class name

## PSR4 based classes 

Encapsulated plugins manage these automatically, by placing the classes in specific diectories.

e.g for admin I can place a class in the plugins `admin/includes/classes/directory`

As an example lets use the current DisplayLogs plugin.

In its `admin/includes/classes/directory` lets add a new class called Cache.php
I've named this to see how it doesn't interfere with the current cache class that Zen Cart uses.

This class looks like 

```php 

<?php<?php

namespace Zencart\Plugins\Admin\DisplayLogs;

class Cache
{
    public function test()
    {
        echo 'FOOOOO';
    }
}
```
now in the admin/display_logs.php file, I can add this call after the line 
```require 'includes/application_top.php';```

```php
$cache = new Cache();
$cache->test
```

When the DisplayLogs plugin is installed we should see the `FOOOOO`output when navigating to its menu entry.

## Custom class filenames

When the filename of a class does not match the class name, we need to do a bit more work.

Again lets create a new class file in the plugins admin/includes/classes directory.

Lets call this file `class.some_weird_class_filename.php`
with the contents 

```php
<?php

namespace Zencart\Plugins\Admin\DisplayLogs;

Class myClass
{
    public function test()
    {
        echo 'BARRRRR';
    }
}
```

now in the admin/display_logs.php file, I can add this call after the line
`require 'includes/application_top.php';

```php
$psr4Autoloader->setClassFile('Zencart\Plugins\Admin\DisplayLogs\myClass', $filePathPluginAdmin['DisplayLogs'] . 'class.some_weird_class_filename.php');
$myClass = new Zencart\Plugins\Admin\DisplayLogs\myClass();
$myClass->test();
```

This should output `'BARRRRR'` on the Display logs page in admin
