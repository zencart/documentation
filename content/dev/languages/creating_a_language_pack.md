## Create Folders and Copy Files

### Essential Files

To create a new language pack you should start by copying all the English files to your new language folder structure.

- Copy `includes/languages/english.php` to `includes/languages/YOURLANGUAGE.php`

- Copy `includes/languages/english/` and all sub directories to `includes/languages/YOURLANGUAGE/`

- Copy `admin/includes/languages/english.php` to `admin/includes/languages/YOURLANGUAGE.php`

- Copy `admin/includes/languages/english/` and all sub directories to `admin/includes/languages/YOURLANGUAGE/`

If old style image buttons are being used then you will also need to create

- `includes/templates/template_default/buttons/YOURLANGUAGE/` and

- `includes/templates/responsive_classic/buttons/YOURLANGUAGE/` then fill with images of the buttons in your language

### Prior to 1.5.7

Prior to version 1.5.7  the `emails` folder contained some English language sections in the templates. 

- `emails` modify the email template files contents from English to your language (these files will overwrite the original distribution files).

### Admin Extras

The Admin pages store a lot of information in the configuration table on the database. 
To do a complete conversion it will be necessary to convert the description fields to your chosen language. This will require a SQL patch.

### Locations of Language Files

These are the locations where you will find language files that may need translating.

                    - more gif files



**Note** You should have this complete directory structure with `english` replaced by `YOURLANGUAGE` so for welsh `YOURLANGUAGE` becomes `cymraeg`

## Modifying the Language Files

Having copied all the English files you should modify the define statements within the files to your chosen language.

e.g. for a Welsh language translation modifying english.php

``` 
// Define the name of your Gift Certificate as Gift Voucher, Gift Certificate, Zen Cart Dollars, etc. here for use through out the shop
  define('TEXT_GV_NAME','Tystysgrif Rhodd');
  define('TEXT_GV_NAMES''Tystysgrifau Rhodd');

// used for redeem code, redemption code, or redemption id
  define('TEXT_GV_REDEEM','Cod Adbrynu');

// text for gender
  define('MALE', 'Br.');
  define('FEMALE', 'Bns.');
```
**NOTE** Any files named `english.php` must be renamed to `YOURLANGUAGE.php`

Eg. For Welsh `english.php` becomes `cymraeg.php`

## Creating Language Overides for Admin Configuration Menu Headings

- Get a full list of the descriptions used in admin.

  You can extract a full set of the admin descriptions from the configuration table using any database management tool (eg phpMyAdmin) and saving to a CSV or text file. A query you could run is:

  `SELECT configuration_key, configuration_title, configuration_description FROM configuration;`

  You will get a file containing:
  
```csv
STORE_COUNTRY, Country, The country my store is located in <br /><br /><strong>Note: Please remember to update the store zone.</strong>
STORE_NAME, Store Name, The name of my store
STORE_OWNER, Store Owner, The name of my store owner
STORE_ZONE, Zone, The zone my store is located in
...

```

- Create an override language defines file to override the descriptions on the database.

   - Edit `admin/includes/languages/YOURLANGUAGE/configuration.php`. This is where you will add the following `defines`...

   - For each entry extracted from the database you need to create 2 `define` statements

       - One for the title, preceding the configuration key with `CFGTITLE_`:  
       `define('CFGTITLE_STORE_NAME', 'Store Name');`
       
       - One for the description, preceding the configuration key with `CFGDESC_`:  
       `define('CFGDESC_STORE_NAME', 'The name of my store');`
       
  E.g. To change the descriptions above from English to the Welsh your file could contain:  
```
<?php
///... pre-existing defines here
///... your new entries will come after them, like this:
/*
 * Admin configuration title and description overrides
 */
define('CFGTITLE_STORE_COUNTRY', 'Gwlad');
define('CFGDESC_STORE_COUNTRY', 'Y wlad y mae fy siop wedi\'i lleoli yn <br /> <br /> <strong> Nodyn: Cofiwch ddiweddaru\'r parth storfa. </strong>');
define('CFGTITLE_STORE_NAME', 'Enw\'r Storfa');
define('CFGDESC_STORE_NAME', 'Enw fy siop');
define('CFGTITLE_STORE_OWNER', 'Perchennog y Siop');
define('CFGDESC_STORE_OWNER', 'Enw perchennog fy siop');
define('CFGTITLE_STORE_ZONE', 'Parth');
define('CFGDESC_STORE_ZONE', 'Mae\'r parth y mae fy siop wedi\'i leoli ynddo');

...

```

It will be necessary to do this for every key you want to change in the Configuration menus.

## Add Your Language Icon

- Place an small image file into `includes\languages\images` to represent your language. This is often the flag of YOURLANGUAGE country. Ideally the image `height` will be approx `14px` in order to match the fonts and line-heights where the image is usually displayed.

## Making The Translation Package User Friendly

- Include a file named _README.txt_ where you say something about what has been translated and what has not, along with any other information you feel is appropriate and helpful to the person using it (including your future self!).

- Create installation instructions (_Install.txt_ or _Install.html_)

- Update the `locale` cues in your language files. This lets Zen Cart match up the locale using the call to _setlocale()_ in the following files:

  `includes/languages/YOURLANGUAGE.php`

  `admin/includes/languages/YOURLANGUAGE.php`

  Specifically, set the correct lookups in the `$locales = ....` line below, as well as the relevant date formats.
```
// look in your $PATH_LOCALE/locale directory for available locales..
  $locales = ['en_US', 'en_US.utf8', 'en', 'English_United States.1252'];
  @setlocale(LC_TIME, $locales);
  define('DATE_FORMAT_LONG', '%A %d %B, %Y'); // this is used for strftime()
  define('DATE_FORMAT', 'm/d/Y'); // this is used for date()
```

## Making Language Pack Available to Others

Having completed your language pack please upload it to the [Language Packs](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=6) section of the Plugins Library.
