# Reporting Bugs

We welcome bug reports. Please ensure your bug reports align with the following standards:

1. A clear description of the symptom, ie: the actual "problem"
2. Clear specific (preferably numbered) steps which can be taken to recreate the problem consistently. 
3. If there are any pre-requisites needed to make the problem possible, such as configuring a certain Tax Rate for a specific State/Country, etc, those need to be clearly listed.
4. Clearly state what you believe it "should" do, and why. If relevant, provide a URL to a resource which confirms the standard ... for example a URL to the correct address-format of a certain country if you're reporting that the formatting is wrong in ZC for that country.
5. Provide screenshots if possible or relevant.
6. If the bug has been discussed on the Zen Cart support forum, include the URL to that discussion thread.
